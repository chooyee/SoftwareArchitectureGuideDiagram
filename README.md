## Introduction

## Purpose of This Guide

The objective of visualizing software architecture is to create a clear, concise, and understandable representation of a software system's structure, behavior, and interactions. This serves several key purposes:

*   **Communication:** Visualizations provide a common language for stakeholders (developers, architects, testers, end users) to understand the system's design. This reduces ambiguity and improves collaboration.
*   **Understanding:** A well-crafted architecture diagram helps everyone involved grasp the system's complexity, identify key components, and understand their relationships. This is crucial for both initial design and subsequent maintenance.
*   **Analysis & Design:** Visualization aids in the analysis phase by allowing architects to identify potential issues, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement _before_ significant coding begins. It facilitates better design decisions by making the system's structure explicit.
*   **Documentation:** Architectural diagrams serve as important documentation, capturing design decisions and providing a reference point for future development and modification. This is especially important for large or long-lived systems.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** By making the architecture visible, potential risks (e.g., performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, scalability issues) can be identified and addressed proactively.
*   **Stakeholder Alignment:** Sharing visualizations with stakeholders ensures everyone is on the same page regarding the system's design and expected functionality, leading to better project alignment and reduced conflicts.

## Basics of Software Architecture

## Definition and Key Concepts

Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, defining its components, their relationships, and how they interact to achieve the system's objectives. It serves as the blueprint that guides development and evolution over time.

Key Concepts:

1.  Components:
    1.  Modular parts of the system, such as services, api gateway, or user interfaces, each responsible for a **specific** function.
    2.  Example: In a Gen AI platform, components include the "RAG Service," "User Authentication (Falaina/Entra ID)" and "Web UI"
2.  Connectors:
    1.  Mechanisms that facilitate interaction between components.
    2.  Examples include APIs, message queues (Kafka and etc), and HTTP protocols.
3.  Architectural Styles:
    1.  Standardized approaches to organizing systems based on specific principles (e.g., monolithic architecture, micro-service architecture, event-driven architecture).

## Types of Software Architectures

Software architecture can take various forms based on the needs of the application, the development team, and the operating environment.

**Common Architectural Styles**

*   **Monolithic Architecture**
    *   Description: All components are tightly integrated into a single application.
    *   Pros: Simple to develop and deploy; good for small teams or applications.
    *   Cons: Hard to scale and maintain as the system grows.
*   **Microservices Architecture**
    *   Description: System is divided into independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
    *   Pros: Highly scalable, allows independent deployment, and supports diverse technology stacks.
    *   Cons: Increased complexity in communication and orchestration.
*   **Serverless Architecture**
    *   Description: Applications are built using managed services where the infrastructure is abstracted away, and code runs in response to events.
    *   Pros: Reduces operational overhead; scales automatically with demand.
    *   Cons: Vendor lock-in and less control over infrastructure.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture**
    *   Description: Components communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous communication.
    *   Pros: Ideal for real-time systems; highly scalable.
    *   Cons: Debugging and monitoring can be challenging.
*   **Layered Architecture**
    *   Description: System is organized into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) with clear separation of concerns.
    *   Pros: Simplifies development and testing; promotes reusability.
    *   Cons: Can become inefficient if layers are overly rigid.

## Principles of Effective Visualization (SASKAF)

Effective visualization of software architecture ensures that architectural diagrams are clear, purposeful, and usable for all stakeholders. This section outlines key principles to follow when creating architecture visualizations.

#### **1\. Simplicity and Clarity**

*   **Avoid Overloading Diagrams:** Focus on key components and their relationships. Exclude unnecessary details that might overwhelm the viewer.
    *   Example: For a high-level audience, show major subsystems and external interfaces, not every internal class.
*   **Use Minimalist Design:** Keep diagrams simple, avoiding excessive colors, icons, or annotations.
*   **Leverage Visual Hierarchies:** Use size, color, and layout to emphasize critical elements and relationships.
    *   Example: Highlight core services in bold or larger boxes, while auxiliary components appear smaller.

---

#### **2\. Audience-Centric Design**

*   **Understand Stakeholder Needs:** Tailor the visualization to the audience’s technical knowledge and goals.
    *   Executives: Need high-level overviews (e.g., context diagrams).
    *   Developers: Require detailed views (e.g., sequence or component diagrams).
    *   Operations Teams: Focus on deployment diagrams or data flow diagrams.
*   **Use Familiar Notations:** Adopt standardized notations like UML (Unified Modeling Language) or the C4 Model to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.

---

#### **3\. Scalability of Visuals**

*   **Design for Growth:** Create diagrams that can easily accommodate future updates or scaling.
    *   Example: Use modular structures where components can be added without reorganizing the entire diagram.
*   **Layered Views:** Provide multiple levels of abstraction to address both high-level and low-level concerns.
    *   Example: A context diagram offers a big-picture view, while component diagrams dive into system internals.

---

#### **4\. Key Relationships**

*   **Highlight Dependencies:** Clearly show how components interact and depend on each other.
    *   Example: Use arrows to indicate data flow or control flow.
*   **Prioritize Critical Paths:** Emphasize the most important workflows or interactions.
    *   Example: In a Gen AI system, prioritize showing the interaction between the web ui service, api gateway, and bedrock/sagemaker service.

---

#### **5\. Annotations and Legends**

*   **Provide Context:** Use annotations to explain non-obvious components or interactions.
*   **Include a Legend:** Define symbols, colors, and notations used in the diagram to avoid confusion.

---

#### **6\. Keep Visuals Up-to-Date and Test**

*   Regularly review and update diagrams to reflect changes in the system.
*   **Iterate as Needed:** Revise based on feedback to improve clarity and usability.
*   **Conduct Usability Testing:** Ask team members or stakeholders to explain the system based on the diagram to identify gaps or misunderstandings.

## Types of Diagrams and When to Use Them

Software architecture diagrams serve different purposes depending on the level of detail and audience. This section explains the most common types of diagrams, their key features, and use cases.

### **Context Diagram**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Provides a high-level view of the system and its interactions with external entities (e.g., users, other systems, services).
    *   Answers the question: _What does this system do, and who or what interacts with it?_
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Shows the system as a single "black box."
    *   External actors (users, other systems, or devices) and their interactions with the system are highlighted.
    *   Minimal technical detail.
*   **Use Case:**
    *   Communicating with non-technical stakeholders, such as business leaders or clients.
    *   Early stages of project planning to align on scope and integrations.

### **Layered Diagram**

**Purpose:**

*   To provide a high-level view of the system’s organization and design.
*   To enforce separation of concerns, where each layer focuses on a specific function.
*   To make the architecture easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   To identify dependencies and communication pathways between different layers.

**Key Features:**

*   **Logical Layers**
    *   Layers are logical groupings of components, not necessarily physical entities.
    *   Examples of typical layers include:
        *   **Presentation Layer:** Handles the user interface and user experience.
        *   **Application Layer:** Manages business logic and rules.
        *   **Data Layer:** Manages data storage and retrieval, including databases and external APIs.
*   **Data Flow**
    *   Data flows vertically between layers.
    *   Lower layers do not typically depend on upper layers, ensuring a unidirectional flow.
        *   Example: Data moves from the database (Data Layer) to the business logic (Application Layer), and finally to the user interface (Presentation Layer).
*   **Abstraction**
    *   Each layer abstracts its implementation details, exposing only necessary interfaces or APIs to the layer above.
    *   This abstraction promotes modularity and ease of testing.
*   **Layer Independence**
    *   Components in one layer should not directly depend on the internal workings of another layer.
    *   Changes in one layer should not require changes in others.

**Common Layers in a Layered Diagram**

1.  **Presentation Layer**
    *   **Role:** Provides the user interface and interacts directly with users.
    *   **Examples:** Web pages, mobile app screens, or command-line interfaces.
    *   **Key Technologies:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript frameworks (React, Next.js), mobile SDKs.
2.  **Application Layer (Business Logic Layer)**
    *   **Role:** Implements core business logic and orchestrates interactions between the presentation and data layers.
    *   **Examples:** Login Authentication, OCR, RAG, Payment Processing.
    *   **Key Technologies:** Backend frameworks (Lambda, Nodejs, Next.js, Python FastApi, Php Laravel and etc).
    *   \*\*Illustrate the **business components (Lambda, ECS)** here

## ADR Example

**FAST Modernization 2024 (ADR-003)**

**Title:** Transition to Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**  
Our current monolithic architecture has become difficult to scale and maintain. As our user base grows, deployments have become riskier, and a single bug can affect the entire application. Additionally, different teams are blocked from working independently on specific features due to the tightly coupled nature of the system.

**Decision:**  
We will transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. Each microservice will encapsulate a specific business capability and will communicate with other services via REST APIs or asynchronous messaging.

**Rationale:**

*   **Scalability:** Microservices enable independent scaling of components based on traffic.
*   **Faster Development:** Teams can work independently on different services, reducing bottlenecks.
*   **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service are less likely to impact the entire system.
*   **Technology Diversity:** Teams can use different technologies or programming languages for specific services if needed.

**Rejected Alternatives:**

1.  **Remain with Monolithic Architecture:**
    *   Simpler to manage, but would continue to hinder scaling and team productivity.
2.  **Adopt Serverless Architecture:**
    *   Offers scalability but may not suit long-running processes or require significant vendor-specific knowledge.

**Consequences:**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Faster delivery of features due to team independence.
    *   Better fault isolation and easier scaling.
    *   Simplified testing and debugging within individual services.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Increased complexity in service orchestration and deployment.
    *   Additional infrastructure requirements (e.g., service discovery, API gateways).
    *   Potential latency in communication between services.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  Decompose the monolith into smaller domains.
2.  Start with critical or high-traffic components (e.g., user authentication, order processing).
3.  Implement an API gateway for routing traffic to appropriate services.
4.  Use Docker containers and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
5.  Establish CI/CD pipelines for each microservice.
6.  Monitor performance and adjust for inter-service latency issues.

**Related ADRs:**

*   ADR-002: "Adopt Kubernetes for Container Orchestration"
*   ADR-001: "Use AWS Cloud Infrastructure"

**Date:** 2024-12-24
